# MedicalImaging

The idea behind the project is to demonstrate the effects of radon transform on MRI images and also to show how changing parameters in the radon transform and inverse radon transform effects image quality.

To run the project simply press the run button in MATLAB. The project displays the DICOM images in the folder through a GUI. You can change the number of projections used for the radon transform, the type of interpolation used for the inverse radon transform, and the filter used on the inverse radon transform.
